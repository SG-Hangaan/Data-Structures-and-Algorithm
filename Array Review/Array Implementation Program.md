# Array Summation

The task of finding the sum of N numbers in an array involves adding together all the elements within the array, where N represents the number of elements to be summed. This process calculates the total value of the array's contents, providing a fundamental operation frequently used in programming and mathematical computations.

# Array Extremes Detection
Finding the maximum and minimum values among N numbers in an array entails identifying the largest (maximum) and smallest (minimum) elements within the array. This operation is crucial in various computational tasks, enabling the determination of the range or extremes within a set of data, making it a fundamental concept in programming and data analysis.

# User-Initiated Data Entry.

Asking the user to input the number of students and quizzes is a common programming task where the program prompts the user to enter two numerical values: the number of students in a class and the number of quizzes each student has taken. This input serves as crucial information for various applications, such as grading systems or statistical analysis. By obtaining these values from the user, the program gains the necessary context to perform calculations, generate reports, or process data specific to the given number of students and quizzes, enhancing the interactivity and customization of the software.

# Array Deduplication Algorithm

Writing a program to delete duplicate values in an array involves creating a computational algorithm that identifies and removes repeated elements within the array. This task is essential for data cleaning and improving the efficiency of algorithms working with unique data sets. The program iterates through the array, identifies duplicate elements, and removes them, resulting in a modified array without any repeated values. This process streamlines data manipulation and ensures the uniqueness of elements within the array, enhancing the integrity of the data set.
